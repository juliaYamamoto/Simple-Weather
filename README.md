# Simple Weather
###### Version 1.0 - november 2020

This is a simple weather aplication that shows the weather of the place you currently are along with other informations as wind speed, rain, current moon state and when the sun will be up or down. You can also change between Celsius(째C) and Fahrenheit(째F)

![Gif showing the main features of the app: It starts with the main screen of the phone opening the new weather application, followed by the main screen of the app asking for localization permission. After the permission is granted, it shows where the user is (city and country) and the current degrees in celsius. The bot menu is opened by scrolling up showing more information about the location as the min and max degrees, moon state, humidity and rain probability.](ReadmeFiles/demoNW.gif)

## Dark Sky API 
To learn more about Dark Sky API [click here](https://darksky.net/dev).
     
Since it uses an ID to identify who is requesting, **you will need to add your own before run the aplication (or it won't work).** It can be easily done by opening the "Contants" class and adding it to the **keyValue** constant, where you can find a comment that says "Add your own key here".
